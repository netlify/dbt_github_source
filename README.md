# GitHub (Source)

This package models GitHub data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/GitHub). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lx6ez7-x-s-n2JCnCi3SjG4XMmx9ysNUvaNCaWc3I_I/edit).

This package enriches your Fivetran data by doing the following
* Adds descriptions to tables and columns that are synced using Fivetran
* Adds freshness tests to source data
* Adds column-level testing where applicable. For example, all primary keys are tested for uniqueness and non-null values.
* Models staging tables, which will be used in our transform package

## Models

This package contains staging models, designed to work simultaneously with our [GitHub modeling package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_github).  The staging models:
* Remove any rows that are soft-deleted
* Name columns consistently across all packages:
    * Boolean fields are prefixed with `is_` or `has_`
    * Timestamps are appended with `_at`
    * ID primary keys are prefixed with the name of the table.  For example, the user table's ID column is renamed user_id.


## Installation Instructions

## Configuration
By default, this package will run using your target database and the `github` schema. If this is not where your GitHub data is (perhaps your gitHub schema is `Github_fivetran`), add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
  github_source:
    github_database: your_database_name
    github_schema: your_schema_name 
```

## Database support
This package has been tested on BigQuery, Snowflake and Redshift.
